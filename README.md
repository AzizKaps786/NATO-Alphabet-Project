<h/>NATO Alphabet Project</h>

Description
The NATO Alphabet Project is a Python program that converts text into the corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet representation. The NATO phonetic alphabet, also known as the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, is a set of standardized phonetic code words used by military and civilian organizations to clearly and accurately communicate letters and numbers over voice communication channels.

This project provides a user-friendly interface for converting any given text input into its NATO phonetic equivalent. It accepts both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and common punctuation marks. The program ensures that each character in the input text is matched to its corresponding NATO phonetic word, helping to improve clarity and comprehension in communication.
